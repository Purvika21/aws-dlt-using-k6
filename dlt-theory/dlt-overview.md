# Distributed Load Testing (DLT)

## Overview
Distributed Load Testing (DLT) is a performance testing approach where load is generated from multiple machines simultaneously to simulate real-world traffic patterns.

In AWS, DLT is commonly performed using multiple EC2 instances running the same test scripts in parallel.

---

## Why Distributed Load Testing?
- Simulates large-scale real-world user traffic
- Avoids limitations of single-machine load testing
- Validates system scalability and stability
- Helps identify performance bottlenecks

## Types of Tests in DLT
- Distributed Load Testing
- Distributed Stress Testing
- Distributed Spike Testing
- Distributed Soak (Endurance) Testing
- Distributed Scalability Testing

## DLT in AWS
AWS provides scalable infrastructure such as EC2, Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch, making it suitable for executing distributed load tests efficiently.
