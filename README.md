# Distributed Load Testing (DLT) using k6 in AWS

## Overview
This repository documents my learning and hands-on implementation of Distributed Load Testing (DLT) using **k6** in an **AWS environment**.

Distributed Load Testing was performed by executing the same k6 performance test scripts across multiple AWS EC2 instances to simulate real-world user traffic and evaluate application performance, scalability, and stability.

## What is Distributed Load Testing (DLT)?
Distributed Load Testing (DLT) is a performance testing approach where load is generated from multiple machines simultaneously. This helps simulate realistic traffic patterns and avoids the limitations of single-machine load testing.
